# Random Background Color Generator || JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

https://celes-sb.github.io/randomBackgroundColor-js/

Welcome to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures repository! This project is part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

## What I did:

- Implemented a random background color changer.
- Debugged existing code to ensure it functions correctly.
- Improved my skills in identifying and fixing code errors.

### Why Share This?

By sharing my progress and projects, I aim to:

1. **Build a Portfolio:** Demonstrate my skills and knowledge in JavaScript and related technologies.
2. **Document My Learning:** Keep track of my learning journey and reflect on my progress.
3. **Help Others:** Provide insights and resources for others who are also pursuing similar learning paths.

Stay tuned for more projects and updates as I continue to explore the fascinating world of JavaScript and web development!
