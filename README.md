Welcome to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures repository! This project is part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

## What I did:

- Implemented a random background color changer.
- Debugged existing code to ensure it functions correctly.
- Improved my skills in identifying and fixing code errors.
